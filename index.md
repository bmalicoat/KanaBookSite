## Kanji Book

I built Kanji Book to aid in my own learning of kanji. I wanted something that would let me learn the 2136 jōyō kanji at my own pace. I was inspired by Japanese style journals which extensively use highlighters and stickers to brighten up the otherwise dull contents. In Kanji Book, you'll build your own workbook which tracks your progress visually. You can learn as many kanji as you want each day. I find that 2 or 3 is a good cadence. I tend to play 3 or 4 times a day, whenever I can find a spare 5 minutes. I try to use my phone as a tool, not a distraction.

As you play, the language of the workbook changes to reflect your knowledge. Practice all aspects of kanji: readings, drawing, recall, definition, and recollection. Use your Kanji Book as simple flashcards or test yourself with 25 random questions. Once you have enough kanji to form compound kanji vocabulary words, you'll end each session with a grid of kanji which you can use to form vocabulary words.

I hope you find some value in Kanji Book. Let me know how many you learn or reach out with any questions - bmalicoat@gmail.com
