## Kana Book

I built Kana Book to help learn and reinforce Hiragana and Katakana. You can use it as a flashcard style study aid or test yourself with 25 random questions. You choose the pace that you learn new characters.

If you master Kana Book, consider checking out [Kanji Book](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kanji-book/id1532844605)!

I hope you find some value in Kana Book. Let me know how many you learn or reach out with any questions - bmalicoat@gmail.com
